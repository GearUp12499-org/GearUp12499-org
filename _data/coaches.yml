  education1: I am Coach Alex Hsu.  Legos were my favorite toy growing up (and still are!), which led me to become involved in Junior FLL when my twin children were in 3rd grade, starting in 2013.  In 2014-2016 I helped mentor them and their friends through three seasons of FLL.  After several challenging, successful, and fun filled years of FLL, we embarked onto the next stage in FTC in 2017.  For the past 10 years, I have been a physician in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, working as a radiologist for Kaiser Permanente in San Diego, California.
