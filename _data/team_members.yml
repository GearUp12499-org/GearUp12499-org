  education1: Hi! My name is Justin Wu, and I’m a junior at Westview High School. This is my third year as a member of team 12499 Gear Up. Other than co-captaining the team with JJ, I mostly help out with the software aspect of our robot, from experimenting with new methods to fine-tuning programs before competitions. Outside of robotics, I enjoy studying competitive programming and playing cello. I’ve learned a lot through FTC in the past two years, and I am excited to continue to grow with the team in coming seasons.
